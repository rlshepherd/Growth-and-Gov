Interest in the fundamental determinants of economic growth remerged in the 1980s, largely in response to mounting evidence that neither the neoclassical nor endogenous grow models can satisfactorily explain the experience of the world's developing countries. The neoclassical growth model, as developed by Solow and Swan (1956), abstracts the determinants of economic output into three categories: capital, labor, and some level of technology. In order to stylize growth so simply, the model rests several key assumptions. First, that technology is determined exogenously and the same technology is available to all countries. Second, that markets function perfectly (or that we are modeling a closed economy). Third, that economies experience diminishing returns to capital accumulation. It is this last assumption which has received the most scrutiny in light of cross-country evidence. Diminishing returns to capital implies the rate of growth in labor productivity would decrease as productivity increased. Under such circumstances, a poorer country would have the opportunity to “catch up” with the productivity growth of a rich country as each moves toward a steady growth state.

In the decades that followed, the experience of most developing countries was, in fact, exactly the opposite. Figure 1 shows that convergence has not been the dominant trend among poor countries. Initial per capita income in 1961 is plotted along the x-axis, while average per capita income growth between 1961 and 2000 is plotted along the y-axis. It is clear from Figure 1 that income in poorer countries, as a whole, is not growing fast than in rich countries.

The development of the endogenous growth model expands on the neoclassical model in an attempt account for these inconsistencies.  Both Paul Romer (1986) and Robert Lucas (1988) suggested expanding the model by relaxing the assumption that technology is country neutral and instead assuming technological progress is endogenously determined. Later formulations of this model (see, for example, Mankiw, Romer and Weil, 1992) account for economies of scale by assuming returns to capital and investment increase rather than diminish. In short, whereas the neoclassical model predicts convergence, the endogenous model predicts divergence. However, if we return out attention to Figure 1, the group of countries in the top left corner of the graph (Singapore is the only such case labeled in Figure 1) all exhibited very high growth rates despite having started with low initial levels of income per capita. In fact, the countries with the highest growth rates all started with less than half the per capita income of the United States. The five fastest growing countries across this period were: Botswana (6.36%), Taiwan (6.22%), Singapore (5.62%), Korea (5.04%), and Hong Kong (4.84%). Redoing this exercise for only the last decade in the dataset (1990 – 2000) reveals similar results, in that a few initially poor countries grew much faster than any others. In the 1990s, Equatorial Guinea, Haiti, and China all averaged over 7 percent income per capita growth.

What then, if not changes in capital (both human and physical) and technology, explains the fast economic growth of a few countries within the developing world, which by and large is not converging? Which aspects of the rapidly developing East Asian “miracle” economies (Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan) are missing from not only from economic models, but the vast majority of developing countries? Robert Lucas (1993) hypothesizes that there are some industrious which promote “learning-by-doing” more than others, and by specializing in these industries (namely export production), economies can create a virtuous cycle of the positive spillovers from these industries driving opportunities for more learning-by-doing. However, cross-sectional analysis into conditional convergence is inherently difficult because of the case-by-case nature of the theory. Instead, researchers have attempted to account for differences in productivity growth by examining the quality of institutions across countries.

<h4>Institutions and Governance.</h4>
<p>
Douglas North (1993) laid the foundations for new investigations into the effect of institutions on economic growth. North defines institutions as, “the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction” (1990). It is important to note that by “rules of the game,” North is not referring to the individual laws and legal systems in a country, but rather the social norms that shape all interactions. Given this very broad scope of this definition of institutions, one can imagine several channels through which institutions would affect economic performance. In addition to identifying these channels, current research has focused on examining the direction of causality between institutions and economic performance, as well as moving from steady-state performance to evaluations of growth dynamics. 
</p>
<p>
One such channel is the ability for individual producers and firms to protect rights to private property and ensure contract obligations are met. Knack and Keefer (1995), in a cross-section of country data from 1974 – 1989, find those institutions which protect property rights and contract enforcement are “crucial to economic growth”. Furthermore, they find initial levels of income per capita are significant determinants of growth once these institutional qualities are controlled for. The authors suggest this finding is compelling evidence for the conditional convergence described by Lucas and others (see, for example, Barro and Sala i Martin, 1992). Olson, Sarna and Swamy (1998) argue that poor countries with better governance are able to exploit opportunities for catch-up growth and out-pace rich countries. They find that International Country Risk Guide (1982) measures of governance explain almost half of the variation in productivity across a set of 68 countries between 1960 and 1987.

The government, in addition to having the ability to provide sound institutions, is often the single largest drain on economic performance. Corruption, confiscatory taxation, and expropriation are all examples of public diversion. There is a large body of literature on the detrimental effects of corruption on economic performance (Mauro, 1995, Loayza ,1995, Tanzi and Davoodi ,1997, and Wei 1997). 
</p>
<p>
Although motivated by North’s concept of institutions, much of the empirical work has focused on more proximal causes of private capture of social return to investments, namely enforcement of law and control of corruption. Constructing or finding appropriate measures of underlying social institutions is the largest obstacle to research along these lines. Hall and Jones (1999) explain differences in productivity levels across countries using measures of “social infrastructure”. The authors measure social infrastructure using indices of governance, similar to those used in Knack and Keefer (1995).  In an attempt to reach the underlying institutional causes of governances, the use language, colonial history, geography and trade as instruments. These instruments capture to what extent a country has ties with Europe, except for the trade variable. Hall and Jones find their measures of Westernization explain about half of cross-country differences in both levels of social infrastructure and productivity. Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001) use settler mortality rates from the 18th and 19th centuries as an instrument for the historical determinants of institutional quality and find similar results.

<h4>Measuring Governance and Growth.</h4>
<p>
Although the connection between governance and growth was strongly established by the end of the 1990s, less was understood about the causal links between governance and growth. While few would dispute institutions that protect property rights and prevent corruption can increase economic performance, the high cost of such institutions is also well documented (citation needed). Governments with few resources are not able to support the necessary institutions to enforce legal codes. Private actors also have a higher stake in enforcement as productivity increases. For example, as profits for a particular firm begin to increase, the benefit of paying for lawyers and courts to enforce property laws begins to outweigh the costs of lost merchandise and contracts. Moreover, the time scale along which institutional reforms affect economic growth (and vice versa) is not captured by studies relating levels of governance to economic output. Finally, most studies cited above blur the distinctions between rich and poor nations by including countries of various initial states of physical and human capital, institutional quality, and growth rates in the same models.  These questions have strong policy implication for developing countries and international donors alike. The remainder of this section focuses on the literature concerning causality, time frames, and thresholds as these concepts pertain to institutions and growth.

There are, in general, two conceptualizations about the relationship between governance and growth. First investment in governance can help increase economic growth, which can in turn be reinvested in even better governance, creating a virtuous cycle of governance and growth. This notion has motivated donors and multinational aid organizations to direct aid at incremental improvements in governance, hoping to start the wheel of income-governance growth turning. Alternatively, it is held by some that countries get the governments (and governance) that they can afford.
</p>
<p>
Chong and Calderon (1999) show evidence for bidirectional causality between institutional quality and economic growth. The authors use an alternative to Granger causality test for time-series, developed by Geweke (1982). They show that for a subset of developing countries, there is a statistically significant relationship from institutional quality to economic growth, and in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the relationship from institutions to growth is stronger when institutional quality scores are averaged across ten year periods. This finding provides evidence for the idea that the benefits institutional reforms take time to manifest, and therefore countries that begin reforms sooner will see greater rewards. 
</p>

Kaufmann and Kraay (2002) show a possible negative relationship between income and governance. The authors use the Rule of Law score from World Bank’s World Governance Indicators (Kaufmann et al., 1999) as a proxy for the quality of institutions. The authors use a simultaneous equation model to evaluate the direction of causality between their measures of governance and income. Their analysis is dependent on non-sample information, for which they define a margin of error around each governance data point. Finding a negative effect from levels of income to levels of governance in the long run, they conclude there is little evidence for a “virtuous cycle” like the one described above. The authors offer several possible explanations for failure of increased incomes to increase demand for quality institutions, including cronyism, regulatory capture and state capture. 
While the evidence for a virtuous governance-growth cycle in the long run is mixed, very little in the literature discusses our second proposition that growth spurs governance improvements. It is possible growth is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for improvement in governance. Kaufmann and Kraay (2002) have shown income levels do not necessarily lead institutional quality, but admit this does not hold true across all countries. Kurtz and Schrank (2007) find that Kaufmann et al.’s measures are not related with higher growth rates in a longitudinal study, that is, they did not find a statistically significant relationship from governance to growth over time. In addition to casting doubt on the “virtuous cycle” theory, their findings provide impetus for further test of the second possible relationship, that growth is the principle driver governance. Perhaps growth-oriented policies (i.e., fostering a developmentalist state) without an emphasis on improving governance, despite being subject to the numerous resource diversions documented in the literature, is the more direct route to both faster growth and better governance.
