<h3>Interpretation and Conclusions</h3>
<p>
The analysis shows weak evidence for a relationship between institutional inclusiveness 
and economic performance, which warrants more robust quantitative analysis.
Only the random effects estimation of the level-on-levels model showed a significant
and positive relationship between the POLITY2 measure of institutional inclusiveness
and annual GDP per capita growth (n = 154, p = 0.14, \(\beta\) = 0.0004).
The RE estimator may be a weaker approach than the FE estimator because we are assuming away country-specific effects that
we intuitively understand to affect the relationship between institutional openness and
economic performance. In practice, there is no reason we should treat the individual effects
as uncorrelated with the regressors. This model could be improved upon by using 
Hausman and Taylor's (1981) specification for the RE estimator, which 
allows for this correlation yet still reports estimation for individual time-invariant characteristics. 
</p>
<p>
The overall goodness of fit for Model 1 (FE estimation of level-on-levels, p = 0.52) is poor,
indicating the model does not satisfactorily explain GDP per capita growth. One possible
solution would be to expand the number of control variables to include all those listed in Section 3. 
FE estimation is not biased time-constant omitted variables, but the model should be tested
for time-varying heterogeneity as well.
</p>
<p>
Model 3 (FE estimation of level-on-levels) show a much better overall fit (\(p = 3.44 \times 10^{-16}\)), and
no statistically significant relationship between annual change in the POLITY2 score and change in 
GDP per capita growth rates. As noted in Section 4, numerically differentiating GDP per capita
twice amplifies the noise component of the data which may introduce measurement error in the model.
Finding a subset of countries with more complete GDP per capita measurements would allow use of
an analytic estimation of change in GDP per capita growth rates and reduce measurement error. Futhermore,
the model assumes an immediate link between our variables of interest by measuring the effect of current
annual change institutional inclusiveness on current change in economic performance. Given the 
pace of government policymaking and reaction times, introducing and testing a series of lagged
institutional measures is justifiable.
